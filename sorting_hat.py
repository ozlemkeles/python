"""
This Python script simulates the process of the Hogwarts Sorting Hat by 
asking the user a series of questions and determining the most suitable
house based on their answers. 
Each house (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin) has a point system, 
and the user's responses contribute to the points of the corresponding houses. 
The house with the highest total points is then revealed as the sorted house for the user.
